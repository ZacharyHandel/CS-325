Web is stateless
- Web server doesn't keep track / store any state information about client connections
- HTTP 1.1
	- Dominos Analogy
- We will have to do something about the web being stateless
	- To have a state, information has to be stored
	- First approach: lets make the client keep up with the information and send it back to the server any time we reconnect
		- THIS is cookies
		- Little note of text that the server has asked the client to keep up with.

2 Possible Solutions to web being stateless:
- Client Stores Info
	- Cookies
		- Organized as name value pairs
		- Server requests that client stores the cookies
		- Client will always send cookies they have with requests
		- Always get sent to domain that requested the cookie in the first place
- Server Stores Info

We need a way to do this in PHP (see file)
